Now, gracious audience, turn all your ears

To a woman whose music deserves your cheers.

A jazzy bird complete with funk and soul

With her amazing voice, many an undeserving heart she stole.

Lest this author’s clumsy words delay her herald

I shall tell you straight forth about Ella Fitzgerald.

In telling this tale of all that she conquered,

I should begin with her birth in A.D. 1917, in Yonkers.

Though she sang in her youth, this woman’s first love was dancing.

Though few have written about it, it was no doubt quite entrancing.

Enough, I hear, for her to test her skills at the famed Apollo Theatre.

Once up on stage, however, Miss Fitzgerald became quite the shy creature.

Silence is golden, truth be told, but as for the audience, they grew bored.

Suddenly, our great heroine discovered her vocal chords.

At the fine suggestion of an unknown stage hand

Ella belted out renditions of Object of My Affection’ and ‘Judy’, it was her grand stand.

Legend has it that she took home the most coveted prize of them all that night

‘Twas merely a glimpse of the career that she would ignite.

For sitting in the theatre audience were musical legends of their time

Chuck Webb, in particular, was looking for a vocalist, sublime.

Would it amaze you, dear reader, as it did me

If I were to say that Miss Fitzgerald wasn’t taken up immediately?

Rather, Webb admitted to be more interested in the physical side

And he was looking for a starlet taller than she was wide.

Fortunately for the good of the world, Webb learned to appreciated her musicality

He recognized her tone, pitch, and sheer vitality.

Working at the renowned night spot Savoy she quickly rose to fame.

Men and women from all over the world came just from hearing her name.

The good songstress collaborated with Mr. Webb for a number of years

Creating hits and earning fame and respect from their peers.

I have now a rather funny anecdote of which I wish to speak

And this is something that was asked of her for years after her peak.

It seems Miss Fitzgerald, though she was a talented singer in her prime

Was most well known for her recording of a nursery rhyme.

A-Tisket, A-Tasket remained popular for years to come

And while others regarded it as a black mark on her stardom

She remained light-hearted and fancy free

Recording other songs of equal whimsy.

Unfortunately her life was not as enviable as it might seem

During her life, she had to endure many trials that would threaten to dampen her dream.

Mr. Chuck Webb passed on a mere five years after their introduction

Leaving Miss Fitzgerald to take charge of the whole production.

Ella had several attempts at marriage, none of which could last

Married at ages 24 and 30, though the ended in divorce rather fast.

An illness of the blood, diabetes cursed her near the end of her life

Affecting not only her blood, but also her sight.

As a result of this disease, she was forced to undergo surgery

During which her legs were amputated above the knee.

Despite these hardships, Ella Fitzgerald had a great and lasting fame

Singing for over sixty years and not being formally trained.

The great songstress had a spectacular three-octave range

Throughout which her clarity and child-like timbre remained.

As for her romance, she did indeed at last hear love’s call

For producer Norman Granz she did fall.

Together, two worked together in love and the arts

Forming a record label that would soon top the charts.

Recording with greats such as Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong

She had found a niche in which to belong.

That is the tale, dear reader, and believe me it is true

If I should lie it is out of ignorance, not falsehood to you.

So take this story of the noble Ella Fitzgerald to mind

And remember it when you need a tale of a woman, kind.

For the fact is, throughout history there are none so quite like her

A good heart, talented, and with a youthful demeanor.
